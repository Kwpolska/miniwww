Mini WWW Generator
==================

A small generator for even smaller webpages.

How to use it?
--------------

Put your assets in the `assets/` directory, source files in `input/` and expect output in `output/`. Look at `inputsample.html` for examples.

This generator was built to play with Python 3.6’s new syntax features (f-strings and variable type annotations) as well as Python typechecking in general (passes `mypy --strict`). As such, it requires Python 3.6 or later.

Does it do X? Is it any good?
-----------------------------

Probably not and probably not. If you’re looking for a real, feature-packed static site generator, look at [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/). (I’m the top 2 contributor to Nikola by commit count.)

What do you use it for?

And some private ones as well. (I’m using different templates/CSS/assets to what is publicly available in this repo.)
